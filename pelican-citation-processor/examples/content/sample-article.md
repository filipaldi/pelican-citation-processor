# Sample Research Article with Citations

This is a sample article that demonstrates how to use the Pelican Citation Processor plugin. The plugin processes citations in the format `[@citation_key]` and automatically generates reference lists.

## Introduction

Recent advances in deep learning have revolutionized the field of machine learning. The publication of "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al. [@DeepLearning2016] marked a significant milestone in the field, providing a comprehensive introduction to the subject.

## Attention Mechanisms

One of the most influential developments in recent years has been the introduction of attention mechanisms. The paper "Attention is All You Need" [@Attention2017] introduced the transformer architecture, which has become the foundation for many modern language models.

## Computer Vision

In computer vision, deep residual networks [@ResNet2016] have shown remarkable performance on image recognition tasks. These networks use skip connections to enable training of very deep architectures.

## Language Models

The development of large language models has been accelerated by the introduction of generative pre-training [@GPT2018]. This approach has led to significant improvements in natural language understanding tasks.

## Theoretical Foundations

For a comprehensive introduction to pattern recognition and machine learning, Bishop's textbook [@PatternRecognition2006] provides excellent coverage of the theoretical foundations.

## Conclusion

The field of machine learning continues to evolve rapidly, with new architectures and techniques being developed regularly. The citations in this article demonstrate how the Pelican Citation Processor plugin can handle various types of academic references.

## References

The references will be automatically generated here by the plugin.
